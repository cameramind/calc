# Camera Calculator Project Plan

This document outlines the major milestones and development phases for improving the Camera Calculator project.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Testing

1. Implement Comprehensive Testing
   - Set up Jest for unit testing
   - Write unit tests for all existing calculation methods
   - Implement integration tests for key features
   - Set up Cypress for end-to-end testing

2. Code Refactoring and Optimization
   - Review and refactor existing code for better readability and maintainability
   - Optimize performance, especially for calculations with large numbers of cameras

3. Error Handling and Input Validation
   - Implement more robust error handling throughout the application
   - Enhance input validation to prevent invalid calculations

## Phase 2: Feature Expansion

4. Additional Codec Support
   - Research and implement support for more video codecs (e.g., AV1)
   - Update UI to accommodate new codec options

5. Multi-Board Comparison
   - Develop a feature to compare multiple board configurations side-by-side
   - Create a new UI component for displaying comparisons

6. Data Export Functionality
   - Implement export options for calculation results (e.g., PDF, CSV)
   - Add a new UI element for initiating exports

## Phase 3: User Experience Enhancements

7. Responsive Design
   - Redesign the UI to be mobile-friendly
   - Implement responsive layouts for all screen sizes

8. Localization
   - Set up i18n framework
   - Translate the application into multiple languages
   - Create a language selection feature

9. Dark Mode
   - Design and implement a dark mode theme
   - Add a theme toggle in the UI

## Phase 4: Documentation and Polish

10. User Documentation
    - Create a comprehensive user guide
    - Implement in-app tooltips and help sections

11. Developer Documentation
    - Write detailed API documentation
    - Create contribution guidelines for open-source collaborators

12. Performance Optimization
    - Conduct performance audits
    - Optimize rendering and calculation processes

## Phase 5: Advanced Features

13. AI-Assisted Recommendations
    - Implement an AI model to suggest optimal configurations based on user requirements

14. Real-time Collaboration
    - Develop a feature for multiple users to collaborate on calculations in real-time

15. Integration with External Systems
    - Create APIs for integrating the calculator with other security planning tools

Each phase and milestone will be broken down into specific tasks in the TODO.md file. This plan is subject to change based on user feedback and project priorities.
